# Analyzing Semantic Change through Lexical Replacements
This repository contains the code accompanying the paper titled "Using Synchronic Definitions and Semantic Relations to Classify Semantic Change Types"

## Paper Abstract
There is abundant evidence of the fact that the way words change their meaning can be classified in different \textit{types} of change, highlighting the relationship between the old and new meanings (among which generalization, specialization and co-hyponymy transfer).
In this paper, we present a way of detecting these types of change by constructing a model that leverages information both from synchronic lexical relations and definitions of word meanings. Specifically, we use synset definitions and hierarchy information from WordNet and test it on a digitized version of Blank's (1997) dataset of semantic change types. Finally, we show how the sense relationships can improve models for both approximation of human judgments of semantic relatedness as well as binary Lexical Semantic Change Detection.
